A platform to run game and collect data about game progression. Animations made using Pts.js library. Will write instructions about running locally when server-side code is implemented.

Game controls:
- ctrl\-s => start game
- ctrl\-e => end game
- ctrl\=m => launch multiple game simulation

Todo:
- Create browser UI for:
    - configuring game players
    - configuring parameters
    - "deploying" experiments (researcher:player clients)
- drogon-core web framework
- implementing webGL games
